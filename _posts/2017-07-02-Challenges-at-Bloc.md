title: My Challenges at Bloc
---

Bloc has a very challenging curriculum that will test the knowledge and memory of any student web developer. Sometimes I will have the exact answer to the problem I am working on, but if I forget a semicolon or capitalize something That shouldn’t be capitalized, it is easy to get stuck and dig yourself into a deeper hole. I have often been told that I have the solution in my head right, but through self-doubt I am reluctant to commit to my solution.

The amount of syntax required for daily web development is astounding. Fortunately, the existence of standard practices cut down on the amount of these small mistakes. Most variables using camelcase syntax, for example, ensures that I almost always have the name of the variable I need is right. The situations I get lost in often involve syntax that can be written several different ways. An example of this would be DOM’s Document.getElementsByClassName() is the same as Jquery’s (“.class”). Trying to remember both of these often results in a mixture between the two, which of course doesn’t work.

Implementation of outside sources of code referenced in links in the checkpoint descriptions has been another challenge with Bloc. After being stuck for a significant amount of time, I will ask my mentor for assistance and be presented with a solution that I would have never thought of. The balance between hand-holding and letting me make my own mistakes is certainly a difficult compromise to weigh, but I feel that it needs some extra fine-tuning.

Though I have faced many challenges with the curriculum at Bloc itself, by far the biggest obstacle in my way has been myself. Learning a new trade in the comfort of my own home is definitely convenient and I have more time to focus on school at home than I would ever have at an institution. Procrastination is a major issue that has threatened to hamper my progress through the coursework. Low confidence is another key issue that can snowball into complete hopelessness when faced with a baffling problem I’ve been asked to overcome. My mentor’s response to any messages I send out for help are a few hours away at the most and are helpful, but many sections can’t be explained through messaging.
