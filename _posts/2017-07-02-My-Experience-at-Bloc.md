title: The Bloc Experience
---
My experience so far with Bloc has been a complicated one, so I’ll document it more or less chronologically.

Upon first signing up for Bloc, I was presented with a list of potential mentors from which I could select for the duration of my course. Having the chance to read short biographies and their skills and experiences was helpful, as I was able to find somebody who was familiar with what I am interested in learning. Ultimately there was not a lot to separate my chosen mentor from a few of the others. One fact, however, stood out to me with a mentor named Allen. Allen has six cats. I have six cats. From there, the choice was obvious.

Some of the first assignments at Bloc had actually re-directed me to another website to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This other website was one I was familiar with, having tried it out before signing up with Bloc. I found their explanations of some concepts to be more confusing that I would have preferred, and was frustrated that I signed up for one service and was sent right back to a service I had already been disappointed by. While I understand the business strategy of contracting outside services to teach the basics, I was hoping for a different angle.

Fortunately, after wrapping up the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript in just a few weeks, Bloc moved on with its own curriculum. Tasked with building a small music playing website based on Spotify, I was guided through the process of including animations, ensuring mobile compatibility, and including basic music player functionality by using DOM first, and then bringing in elements of Jquery. With my first project complete with the help of weekly voice meetings with my mentor through a Skype-like service, I was asked to re-create the app using Angular.

The introduction of Angular was what really began to confuse me. By copying and pasting large blocks of code from the previous project, it felt like I was implementing aspects of Angular into the middle of a half-complete app. Keeping track of what features were enabled and what weren’t helped to develop my awareness of the app’s structure. Sometimes I would be frustrated by what I dubbed, “teaching through links”. Entire explanations of some concepts were taught through a link to the official Angular documentation. What I felt I needed was a more carefully explained concept by somebody trying to teach a student of web development.

After finishing the Angular version of Bloc Jams, I created the Bloc Chat app. By using Google’s Firebase database, I learned how to gather information from user inputs and display them live. With modals, I was taught the ability of using forms to assign chat room names and user names. In addition, this was my introduction to cookies. CSS skills were also put to the test to design an interface that was logical and attractive. 

Following the completion of this portfolio using Jekyll, I will be moving into back-end development. Bloc’s curriculum is definitely challenging, but with weekly mentoring sessions, I feel that I am always learning something new.
