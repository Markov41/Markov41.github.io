title: Why Bloc?
---
When I signed up for Bloc, I was working as a paramedic for a local EMS service. Exhausted with a career that I felt could end at any moment through injury, motor vehicle accident, or a crucial mistake in patient care, I began to seek options for a career that would keep me off the road all day. After considering my hobbies, web development seemed to be the obvious choice for a suitable change. Experiencing all that the web development community had come up with first-hand, I am looking forward to making my own contributions to the web.

The internet has developed to the point where there is so much information freely available to everyone. I have been able to craft incredible meals thanks to recipe-dedicated websites and tutorial videos on sites such as YouTube. Medical websites such as WebMD can assist in home treatment for minor maladies and injuries. I can buy the most obscure products from online stores and have them shipped to my home without even standing up from a chair. Contributing to such a vast network of limitless information is an exciting prospect.

Along with the increasing amount of information available on the web, the user experience has improved over time as well. Carefully considered positioning of every element on a page, combined with trial and error and analytics, any user can find exactly what they need with minimal time invested. If I’m looking for a job, I know nine times out of ten, the ‘careers’  section will be in the footer of the main page. Improved search results have also assisted in the user’s goal of finding a particular bit of information.

My goals upon completion with Bloc are to create apps and websites that are as user friendly as possible, with no intrusive advertisements or videos that play as soon as you navigate to the page. To de-incentivize usage of add-ons such as AdBlock, your guests need to feel welcome to the site and not be overwhelmed with ads. Requiring signups for a newsletter or disabling an Ad-blocker may be smart business in the short term, but as an experienced user myself, I know that I will simply find the information on another website than submit to demanding expectations that I have no say in.

With my education at Bloc, I am hoping to have a wide list of options that I can apply my skills towards. I have learned that web development can include many areas of business.  Though I am certainly focused on the commerce line of business, I feel assured that the tools given to me by Bloc empower me with a broad array of potential careers.
